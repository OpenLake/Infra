## About the Project <sup>[â†¥ Back to top](#table-of-contents)</sup>

The **OpenLake Infrastructure** repository is the backbone of OpenLakeâ€™s internal systems.  
It consolidates all the tools, scripts, bots, and configurations that streamline operations across OpenLakeâ€™s projects and servers.

### ðŸ§© Key Goals
- Automate repetitive DevOps and community management tasks.
- Manage and monitor OpenLakeâ€™s servers, bots, and GitHub automations.
- Provide a transparent and organized place for infrastructure-related contributions.

### ðŸ‘¥ Target Audience
- **OpenLake developers** who maintain our servers, repositories, and bots.
- **Contributors** looking to add automation or improve operational efficiency.

### ðŸŒŠ Part of the OpenLake Ecosystem
This project supports other OpenLake projects by maintaining their infrastructure â€” ensuring smooth CI/CD pipelines, community automation, and reliable server uptime.

## Getting Started <sup>[â†¥ Back to top](#table-of-contents)</sup>

### Prerequisites
Install dependencies based on the module you want to run.

```bash
# For Node.js scripts
npm install

# For Python scripts
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

<<<<<<< HEAD
```bash
git clone https://github.com/openlake-org/openlake-helper-bot.git
cd openlake-helper-bot
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

```
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_personal_access_token
GITHUB_ORG=openlake-org
```

4. Configure the bot settings in `config.json` or relevant config files (if applicable).

### Running the Bot

```bash
npm start
```

---

## Usage

Once the bot is online and invited to your Discord server:

* It will automatically fetch and update issue and PR counts for configured repositories.
* Notifications will be sent to designated channels on specific GitHub events.
* Use bot commands (if any) to get on-demand reports or updates.
  *(Example commands can be added based on implementation)*

---

## How It Works

* The bot uses the GitHub REST API to fetch data about issues and pull requests from Openlake repositories.
* It listens for events or periodically polls the API to keep data updated.
* Using the Discord.js library, it posts messages, updates, and notifications to specified channels.
* The bot can be extended to add more functionality as Openlakeâ€™s needs grow.
